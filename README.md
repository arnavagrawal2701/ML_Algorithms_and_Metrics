# ML Algorithms and Metrics
This project looks at the following models:
  1) Classification Model (Breat Cancer Prediction)
  2) Linear Regression Model (Housing Price Predicton)
  
It also tells us their respective metrics i.e. Mean Squared Error (Linear Regression Model) and Accuracy Score (Classification Model).
